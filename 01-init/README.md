# Golang workshops

## Why Go?

- Easy deploy (no... EASY deploy)
- no code style problem anymore =gofmt=
- included package manager =go get=
- super fast build system
- great standard library template/html, performant www servers, json, xml
  streams, io, buffers, powerful first class citizen concurrency
- hype w internetach
- easy dev environment setup
- it's not OO language


## Why not Go?

- there's no included package versioning manager (go get only honors URLs?)
  3rd party - godep
  there are plans to make experimental flag in go 1.5 to lower package mess
- young libraries


## Go basics

- types
- structs
- functions
- channels
- testing
- standard library

## Examples

- simple webserver
- shell binary
